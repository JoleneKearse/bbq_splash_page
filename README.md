# bbq_splash_page

Final project of the Scrimba Frontend Career Path Module 6: Responsive Design. This BBQ Splash Page is fully responsive using clamp() & media queries. Also uses JavaScript to display a confirmation & has a CSS media query for prefers-color-scheme: dark.

![Screenshots of the BBQ signup page for desktop, one on mobile with dark mode enabled, and the mobile congratulations page](https://github.com/JoleneKearse/bbq_splash_page/blob/main/social_screenshot.png)

The 'extras' I added include:
- focus states on input fields
- focus & hover states on the button
- (These include transitions which change the font-weight, color, background-color & box-shadow)
- media queries for 
  - prefers-color-scheme: dark
  - mobile devices in landscape mode
  - an additional fix for a small width range in mobile landscape, where the desktop layout fit better.
- slightly different text styles for the Congratulations message and a new image
- a reload function to clear the form

This screenshot shows a run through of the site:

Or, better yet, checkout the **live site**: [on Github Pages](https://jolenekearse.github.io/bbq_splash_page/)!

P.S. I extensively tested this site on multiple browsers using the responsive view in Dev Tools and my own devices.
